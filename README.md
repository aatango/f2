//An implementation of the direct stiffness method for planar frame analysis.
A planar frame analysis tool, developed for educational purposes.

This repository is to contain the underlying libraries needed for the calculation, as well as a simple command line application to allow for their execution.

## Why?
There are two main motivations for this endeavour: firstly the desire to procude a "non-trivial" project to help me develop my software development skills; it also has the long term goal of becoming an alternative to an educational tool that existed at the time I was studying structural engineering, but seems to have since gone behind a registration paywall.
