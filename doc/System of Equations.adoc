We decompose the global stiffness matrix onto its LDLT decomposition, before solving the system of equations.

To restrain a given degree of freedom (DOF) and still use Cholesky decomposition, we need to do two intermediate steps:
- turn the constrained DOF into its identity (ie. every row and column of that DOF become zero, except for the DOF itself, which becomes 1); and
- turn the associated force component into zero.

We can now solve the system of equations and obtain all global displacements. Afterwards, we can recompute the force components for the restrained displacements, thus obtaining the global nodal reactions.
